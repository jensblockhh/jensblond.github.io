# Brewing Beer

## Malting grain

![](malting.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

The one main ingredients of beer, besides of water, is malt. Malt is grain which was soaked with water to let it germinate. In this process the grain is starting to create enzyms. These enzyms are important for the transformation of starch into sugar. After the germination is stopped and the grain will be dried.

## Malt milling

![](milled_malt.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

One of the main grains in beer is barley. Barley is perfect because it comes with husks. These husks must stay inact, they will be building a filter for the mash. Due to this, the malt must be milled in a special way. The core must be broken, but the husks must stay intact.

## Heating water

![](heating.jpg)

Regarding to the recipe the water must have a defined temperature between 50 and 62 degrees. 

---

class: center, middle

## Mash in

![](mashin.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

When you msh in the malt, the temperature of the water will decrease in a few degrees. This must be kept in mind to start with the right temperature. Stirring is very important, otherwise the malt will build nests, which stay dry.

## Mashing

![](mashing.jpg)

This is one of the most important steps. In this step the enzyms will start with their work. Their work is called amylasen.

### Protein rest

---

class: center, middle

### Maltose rest

**Alpha-amylase**

This step is happening in the temperature zone between 61 and 63 degrees celsius. The enzyms are transforming starch into fermentable sugar. The longer this step is, the more alkohol will be later in the beer. The duration of this step is between 30 and 60 minutes. Stirring is very important.

---

class: center, middle

### Saccification rest

**Beta-amylase**

This step is happening in the temperature zone of 71 and 73 degrees celsius. The enzyms are transforming the rest starch into non fermentable sugar, which will produce a better body of the beer. The duration of this step is between 15 and 40 minutes. Stirring is very important.

## Mash out

With the mash out, the amylases will be stopped and all enzyms will stop working. The mash out is happening with the temperature of 78 degrees celsius. This step usaly takes 10-15 minutes

## Lautering

---

class: center, middle

To split the mash into wort and treber. Give the mash 10 to 15 minutes to let the husks sink to the ground. The husks will build a nice filter. For this you need a screen to let the husks stay in the mash pan. The first few liters you get out of it, should be put back into the mash until the wort gets clearer. Please try to

## Sparging

![](sparging.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

The sparging process is needed to wash all of the rest sugar out of the treber. It is done with 80 degrees celcius hot water with the amount of around 1/3 of the full batch.

---

class: center, middle

## Heating the mash

![](heating_mash.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

In the wort pot the wort get cooked when it reaches the targeted amount with the right gravity. Sometimes you put in the hops already. Depends on the recipe.

---

class: center, middle

## Cooking hops

![](cooking_hops.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

From the moment the wort is cooking the bittering hops are added and cooked around 60 minutes. 15 minutes before the cooking time ends you will add the aroma hops to get a aroma instead of bittering from the hops.

---

class: center, middle

## Whirlpool

![](whirlpool.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

When cooking is finished we start with a whirlpool, where the hot wort is stirred to create a whirl. Through centrifugal power the lees (Hops, protein and some treber) will build a cone in the middle of the pot where it should stay.

## Chilling

![](chilling.jpg)

The hot wort will be chilled down to 25 degrees celcius through a cooling spiral and transferred to the fermenting tank.

---

class: center, middle

## First fermentation

![](fermenting.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

In the fermenter the chilled wort will be mixed with the yeast, which was activated some hours before. Then hopefullt the fermentation will start in the next hours. This is the most critical time, where the wort can be infected and get sour. Now the main work is done by yeast cells as they are transforming maltose sugar into alcohol and CO2. The fermentation needs around 6 days to be finished. An airlock is neccessary.

## Second fermentation

![](second_fermentation.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

Shortly before the end of the first fermentation the beer is transferred into bottler, kegs or conditioning tanks. In this stage the rest maltose sugar will produce C02 as well, but the CO2 will stay in the liquid, because the vessels are closed. This stage should be in the same conditions as the first fermentation.

---

class: center, middle

## Conditioning

![](conditioning.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

After a few days the beer must be conditioned for nearly 6 weeks in a cold environment, the colder the better. 2 degrees celsius is perfect - 8 will be fine as well.

---

class: center, middle

## Filling

![](filling.jpg)

---

class: center, middle

If you conditioned your beer in tanks or kegs you might want to fill it into bottles. This must be done in cold condition and with a special tool. A counterpressure filler is needed, otherwise the beer will produce to much foam to fill it into bottles.
